let str1 = "hello there";
let str2 = str1;
str2 = "goodbye!";

//What will the following code output?

//My Solution
/* The output is hello there since we are dealing with strings. 
In JavaScript, strings are primitive values and are immutable; 
they can't be changed. That also means that JavaScript creates a 
new copy of the string when assigning a string to a variable. 
Thus, line 2 assigns str2 a new string that happens to be a copy 
of str1's value. Line 3, in turn, assigns str2 to an entirely new string. */
