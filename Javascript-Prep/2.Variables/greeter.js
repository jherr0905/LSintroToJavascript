/* Write a program named greeter.js 
that greets 'Victor' three times. 
Your program should use a variable and 
not hard code the string value 'Victor' in each greeting. 
Here's an example run of the program:
$ node greeter.js
Good Morning, Victor.
Good Afternoon, Victor.
Good Evening, Victor. */

const nameOfVictor = 'Victor';

console.log(`Good Morning, ${nameOfVictor}`);
console.log(`Good Afternoon, ${nameOfVictor}`);
