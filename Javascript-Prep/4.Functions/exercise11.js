/* Using the code from Exercise 9, are the left and right variables on 
lines 1 and 2 the same as the left and right variables on lines 10-12? Explain your reasoning. */

//Solution
// The left and right parameters on line 1 are local variables since function parameters 
//are always local to the function. Thus, line 2 refers to the local variables.
