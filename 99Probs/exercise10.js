/* In your JavaScript console, execute the following 
two lines of code to check whether their return values 
differ and if so, how. Take a look at the MDN documentation 
on equality comparisons to read about how == and === differ.*/

'8' == 8; // logs true
'8' === 8; // logs false

//Solution
//The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands 
//are equal, returning a Boolean result

// equality (==) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, 
//returning a Boolean result. Unlike the strict equality operator, 
//it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.
